Quick heuristics (you can ask yourself):

Am I deciding on each element in order?
â†’ use choose/skip (no loop needed).
(e.g. subsets)

Am I building a sequence where each step can come from many options?
â†’ use for loop inside recursion.
(e.g. permutations, combination sum, N-Queens, word search)

Do I need to skip duplicates?
â†’ sorting + for loop with if (i > start && nums[i] === nums[i-1]) continue is the standard pattern.
